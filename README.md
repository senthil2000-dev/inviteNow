# webdevTask3
## Delta task 3 all features implemented along with addition features
1. Clone the repo, create a database called 'invitenow' in php myadmin by importing invitenow.sql file and ensure that the username and password of sql connection matches    the one in the includes/config.php.
2. In the google-login.php, in the 'GetAcessToken' function call and in settings.php files change the redirect uri parameter to the           absolute path of inviteNow/google-login.php according to your domain name.
3. For the google calendar api to work, it requires to be added as a authorised redirect uri to the google console developers page. So in    case the redirect uri has been changed but if the host is still using my app's clientId and clientSecret, kindly pm me so that I may       add that uri as an authorised one.
